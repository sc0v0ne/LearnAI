Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams

Tom Demarco, 2nd ed., 1999. 


# Part I Managing the Human Resource

## Chapter 1

Out of 500+ project histories, 25% of projects that lasted 25 work-years or more failed to complete

> The High-Tech Illusion!

The major problems of our work are not so much technological as sociological in nature.

But managers manage as though technology were their principal concern.  They are forever on the lookout for a technical whiz-bang that promises to automate away part of their work.  The most strongly people-oriented aspects of their responsibility are often given the lowest priority.



## Chapter 2

Development is inherently different from production.

> Encourage people to make some errors.

The view that managers provide all the thinking and the people underneath them just carry out their bidding.

There is nothing more discouraging to any worker than the sense that his own motivation is inadequate and has to be "supplemented" by that of the boss [or contractor].

> Managers go to great lengths to convince themselves that noone is irreplacible.

> Uniqueness is what makes project chemistry vital and effective. It is something to be cultivated.


## Chapter 3

Spanish vs English Management Theory

_Productivity_ ought to mean achieving more in an hour of pay, but all too often it has come to mean extracting more for an hour of pay (unpaid overtime).

> Overtime for salaried workers is a figment of the naive manager's imagination.

> Noone can consistently work more than forty hours with the level of intensity required for creative work.

> You need to take turnover into account when you set out to attain higher productivity.

Most organizations cannot tell you what replacement of an experienced worker costs.

> Productivity has to be defined as benefit / cost.

> People under time pressure do not work better; they just work faster.

> To work faster, they have to sacrifice the quaility of the product and their own job satisfaction.


## Chapter 4

We all tend to tie our self-esteem strongly to the _quality_ of the product we produce -- not the quantity of product, but the quality.

Managers jeopardize product quality by setting unreachable deadlines.

To pressure people into delivering a product that does not measure up to their own quality standards is a mistake.

> Quality (far beyond that required by the end user) is a means to higher productivity.


## Chapter 5

**Parkinson's Law:** Work expands to fill the time alloted for it.

Bureaucracies give little job satisfaction to their workers.

> Projects for which there were no estimates had the highest productivity of all.

**Corollary to Parkinson's Law:** Organizational busy work tends to expand to fill the working day.


## Chapter 6

Here are some notes on software development

### 7 False Hopes of Software Development

1. There is some new trick you have missed that could send productivity soaring.

2. Other managers are getting gains of 100% or more.

The typical magical tool that is touted to you is focused on the coding and testing part of the life cycle.  But even if coding and testing went away entirely, you could not expect a gain of 100%.  

There is still all the analysis, negotiation, specification, training, acceptance testing, conversion, and cut-over to be done.

3. Technology is moving so swiftly that you are being passed by.

Most of what you do is not high-tech work.

We still spend most of our time working on requirements and specification which are the low-tech part of our work.

4. Changing languages (such as Java) will give you huge gains.

Programming languages only impact the implementation part of the project.  It might give you a 5% gain but not more.

5. Because of the backlog, you need to double productivity immediately.

The much talked about _software backlog_ is a myth.  

We all know that projects cost a lot more at the end than what we expected them to cost at the beginning.  

The typical project that is stuck in the mythical backlog is there because it has barely enough benefit to justify building it.

6. You automate everything else; isn't it about time you automated away your software development staff?

This is another variation of the high-tech illusion: the belief that software developers do easily automatable work.  

Their principal work is human communication to organize the users' expressions of needs into formal procedure.  That work will be necessary no matter how we change the life cycle.

7. Your people will work better if you put them under a lot of pressure. They won't -- they will just enjoy it less.

**Key Idea:** The manager's function is not to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work.

# Part II The Office Environment
  

## Chapter 7

Provide some areas where a conversation can take place without disturbing others (NOT a cubicle).

Bad Examples:

1. New office space has a cubicle as a meeting area.
    
2. Managers who leave their doors open during meetings.
    
3. Dilbert is popular because it pokes fun at the cubicle.
    
4. Would you have been able to study in a cubicle?
    
5. The PA system.
    
6. How much do you save in office furniture? How much do you lose in productivity?

Office space be considered an investment rather than an expense.

The cost of workspace for one developer is a small percentage of the salary paid to the developer.

You will save a small amount on workspace but it will cost you much more in lost productivity.

7. I get the most/best work done after 5 pm when everyone has gone for the day.

People work better in natural light.


## Chapter 8

Coding War Games: Productivity Factors

### 3 rules of thumb

1. The best people outperformed the worst by about 10:1
   
There is also a 10:1 difference in productivity among software organizations.
   
Something about their environment and corporate culture is failing to attract and keep good people or is making it impossible for even good people to work effectively.
   
2. The best people were about 2.5 x better than the median performer.

3. The half that are better-than-median performers out-performed the other half by more than 2:1.

The following factors have little or no affect on performance:

- Language
- Years of experience
- Number of defects: In fact, the zero-defect workers performed better on average.
- Salary


### Chapter 9

The total investment in the worker could easily be 20 times the cost of his or her workplace (20:1).

Workers who reported that their workplace was acceptably quiet were 1/3 more likely to deliver zero-defect work.


## Chapter 10

**Myth:** Work accomplished is proportional to the number of paid hours worked.


## Chapter 13
 
Windows!

# Part III The Right People

### Formula for success

1. Get the right people. 
2. Make them happy so they don't want to leave.
3. Turn them loose.


### Chapter 14
 
Corporate culture is unhealthy:

1. Pressure to hire/promote workers who look, act, and think like everyone else (do what they are told -- a perfect drone; "Borg").
  
2. Sign of insecurity on the part of management.
  
3. Why do almost all managers wear suits?

> The most successful manager is the one who shakes up the local entropy to bring in the right people and let them be themselves, even though they may deviate from the corporate norm.


## Chapter 15
 
> There seems to be an unwritten rule that says it is okay to ask the candidate about past work but not to ask to see it.


## Chapter 16

### Questions

- What annual employee turnover has your organization experienced over the last few years?

- How much does it cost on average to replace a person who leaves?

- How much does it cost on average to hire a contractor?


### Short-term Perspective

- Optimize for the short term, exploit people (such as contractors), cheat on the workplace, and do nothing to conserve its very lifeblood, the peopleware that is its only real asset.

- Agricultural analogy: We would eat our seed corn immediately and all starve next year.

> In companies with low turnover, the hierarchy is low and flat.

> It is always cheaper in the short run to fire the person who needs retraining and hire someone else (such as a contractor) who already has the required skills. The best organizations do not do this.


## Chapter 17

### Over-automation

If the business policy governing the new system has a sufficient degree of natural adhoc-cracy, it is a mistake to automate it.


### Methodology

- A "fat book".

- An attempt to centralize thinking.

- People are not smart enough to do the thinking.

- Can do grievous damage to efforts in which the people are fully competent.

- Tries to force the work into a fixed mold that guarantees:
 
  1. Paperwork
  2. Methods
  3. No Responsibility - blame the Methodology
  4. No Motivation

- The view that knowledge is so valuable, we must use it sparingly.

- **Malicious Compliance:** People will do exactly what the Methodology says, even when they know doing so is a waste of time.

- The obsession with Methodologies in the workplace is another instance of the "high-tech illusion".


### Convergence of Method

- A good thing. 

- Methodologies are not the only way.

- Better ways:
  
  1. Training
  2. Tools
  3. Peer Review

- A standard is defined as a proven method for undertaking a repeated task demonstrated widely and successfully within Dupont.

- Hunting out new approaches and imposing them as standards before anyone in the organization has even tried them out.

**Hawthorne Effect:** People perform better when they are trying something new.

The total of all standards imposed upon your people should be described in no more than ten pages.

# Part IV Growing Productive Teams

## Chapter 18

Good work experiences always have a measure of challenge to them.

> team + jell = momentum

Professional developers are supposed to accept their employer's goals as a condition of employment. 

Throughout the upper ranks of the organization, there is marvelous ingenuity to be sure that each manager has a strong personal incentive to accept the corporate goals. At the bottom (where the real work is performed) this ingenuity fails. 

Managers do not take particular care to foster jelled teams. 

- Part of the reason is an imperfect understanding of why teams matter.  

- The insecure manager is threatened by them.


## Chapter 20
 
### Teamicide

- defensive mgmt
- bureaucracy
- physical separation
- time fragmentation
- reduced product quality
- phony deadlines
- clique control

### Defensive Management

- Only his own judgement was competent; anyone else's was suspect
- Prescriptive Methodologies
- Technical interference by the manager

**Solution:**

- Let them make some mistakes
- Override a decision rarely

### Bureaucracy

Paperwork accounts for more than 30% of the cost of producing a product. 

> paperwork = pure bureaucracy = mindless paper pushing

**Physical Separation:** When they are all on the same team, they tend to go into quiet mode at the same time. 

**Fragmentation of Time:** Bad for teams, bad for efficiency. 

**Quality-Reduced Product:** The steps we take to deliver a product in less time result in lower quality. 

**Clique Control:** The team phenomenon is something that occurs only at the bottom of the hierarchy. 


## Chapter 22
 
> **Open Kimono:** trust the people under you and don't second-guess. 

Visual supervision is a joke for development workers.

Visual supervision is for prisoners!


## Chapter 23
 
chemistry = good managers devote their time to building and maintaining healthy chemistry. 

The judgement that a still imperfect product is "close enough" is the death knell for a jelling team.

closure = successful completion of work assigned. 

Divide the work into _milestones_ and make sure that each piece has a substantial demonstration of completion.

If you could effect some change in the people you manage and make them more productive and goal-oriented but also less controllable, would you do it?

> If a team knits, don't break it up!

Teams are made up of peers, equals that function as equals.

> There is no hierarchy in team! JH

On the best teams, different individuals provide occasional leadership, taking charge in areas where they have particular strengths. 

> The structure of a team is a network, not a hierarchy!

> A little bit of heterogeneity can be an enormous aid to create a jelled team.

# Part V It's Supposed to be Fun to Work Here

## Chapter 24

### Constructive reintroduction of small amounts of disorder:

- pilot projects
- war games
- brainstorming
- training, trips, conferences, and retreats

### Pilot Projects

- Documentary consistency but not functional consistency. 
- Don't experiment with more than one aspect of development technology. 

## Chapter 25
 
- loosely stated responsibilities so that the individual has a strong say in defining the work. 

- blank check

> The mark of the best manager is an ability to single out the few key spirits and turn them loose: get out of their way. 


## Chapter 27
 
- motivational accessories: managment believes these virtues can be improved with posters rather than hard work and managerial talent.

- extended overtime reduces productivity


## Chapter 28
 
- competition inhibits team jell
- peer-coaching
- sports team as a metaphor is a bad idea. 
- Team: the success of the individual is tied to the success of the whole. 


### Managerial actions that have teamicidal side effects:

- annual salary or merit reviews
- management by objectives
- recognizing individual accomplishment
- performance awards
- performance measurements


## Chapter 29
 
- To extrapolate from the success of interface standards to the need for process standards is a bit of a stretch. 

- Identifying an ideal practice is a useful endeavor, but mandating such a practice is a bad idea.

- Competent people are involved with process improvement all the time. 

- Formal process improvement moves responsibility from the individual to the organization: institutionalize. 

- Higher proficiency is unlikely to reduce risk.

- The more you improve the way you go about your work, the harder the work will be. 

- As we make progress in process improvement, we need more talented people to do the work.

- Focus on the Key Process Areas (KPAs), but turn off the institutional score-keeping.

The projects most worth doing are the ones that will move you DOWN one full level on your process scale. 


## Chapter 30
 
- Resistance to change
- Satir change model

> The fundamental response to change is not logical, but emotional. 

It is frustrating and embarassing to abandon approaches and methods you have long since mastered, only to become a novice again.


## Chapter 31
 
- expense/investment/capitalize

- bottom-line = shortsighted; fails to preserve long-term investment

> Companies that downsize are admitting that their upper management has blown it. 


## Chapter 32
 
Experience gets turned into learning when an organization alters itself:

- instills new skills and approaches in its people
- redesigns itself

> Learning is limited by an organization's ability to keep its people. 

The Management Team = made up of middle-management

Teams of managers = teamicidal effects

> One thing team needs to jell: ownership of work product. 

Learning happens in the white space. 


## Chapter 33
 
Ultimate management sin = wasting people's time

> It is not a meeting; it is a ceremony

> Meetings meet manager's need for reassurance. 

Status meeting:

- purpose is to reach consenus
- ad-hoc; not regularly scheduled

> When bosses are needy, nonattendence is regarded as a threat. 

A fragmented team is teamicidal and is guaranteed to waste the individual's time from switching gears. 

The human capital invested in your work force represents a ton of money. 


## Chapter 34
 
"Politics, the Noble Science" by Aristotle

5 noble sciences: metaphysics, logic, ethics, politics, and aesthetics

> Aristotelian politics is the key practice of good management.
