# LearnAI

If you are like me and try to follow the principles of DRY, KISS, Design Patterns, Occam’s Razor, and other software engineering best practices then this repo is for you!

**NOTE:** The latest version of the repo is available via Obsidian Publish at https://notes.cogentcoder.com


> Don't reinvent the wheel (DRTW)

> Occam’s Razor: The simplest algorithm that fits the data is usually the best. - simple is better

> Complex theories do not work, simple algorithms do. – Vladimir Vapnik


> No Free Lunch Theorem: There is no such thing as “best”. 

**No Free Lunch Theorem:** There is no such thing as "best". When the performance of all optimization methods is averaged across all conceivable problems, they all perform equally well. Thus, no one optimum optimization algorithm exists.

## Background

As an AI/ML engineer, you should be willing to settle for “good enough” rather than trying to find the “best” model/approach.

Scrum is a popular project management approach but not really a software development methodology [1]. I prefer using an iterative, agile feature-driven development (FDD) methodology where team members are able to work independently without the rigid constraints of Scrum [2].

This repo contains notes from various articles and other resources on a variety of topics in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). 

This is a work in progress (just getting started), so there is still a lot missing and the content is changing.
