- bat (batmab and prettybat)
- duf
- fkill
- fzf
- hstr
- httpie
- mktemp
- rich
- ripgrep
- screen
- Shellcheck
- tmux

### awk

awk is a pattern scanning and text processing language which is also considered a programming language specifically designed for processing text.

### Lucidchart

[Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/)

Lucidchart is a diagraming tool that also has shared space for collaboration and the ability to make notes next to diagrams.

### Screen

[Screen](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-use-linux-screen/)

Screen is a GNU linux utility that lets you launch and use multiple shell sessions from a single ssh session. The process started with screen can be detached from session and then reattached at a later time. So your experiments can be run in the background, without the need to worry about session closing, or terminal crashing.

### httpie

HTTPie is a command-line HTTP client. Its goal is to make CLI interaction with web services as human-friendly as possible. HTTPie is designed for testing, debugging, and generally interacting with APIs & HTTP servers. 

The http and https commands allow for creating and sending arbitrary HTTP requests using a simple and natural syntax and provide formatted and colourized output.

### Multipass

[Multipass](https://multipass.run) is a VM platform (perhaps better than VirtualBox and VMWare).

Multipass can be used on Ubuntu, Windows 10, and macOS (including Apple M1) with exactly the same command set.

### rich

rich makes it easy to add colour and style to terminal output. It can also render pretty tables, progress bars, markdown, syntax highlighted source code, tracebacks, and more — out of the box.


### tmux

`tmux` is a terminal multiplexer that allows you to access a tmux terminal using multiple virtual terminals.

`tmux` can be used when you want to detach processes from their controlling terminals which allows remote sessions to remain active without being visible.

tmux takes advantage of a client-server model which allows you to attach terminals to a tmux session which means: 

- You can run several terminals at once concurrently off a single tmux session without spawning any new terminal sessions.

- Sudden disconnects from a cloud server running tmux will not kill the processes running inside the tmux session.

tmux also includes a window-pane design which means we can run more than one terminal on a single screen.

```bash
  tmux new -s session_name
```

**Detach from Tmux Session**

Detach from the Tmux session and return to your normal shell by typing: Ctrl + b d

The program running in the Tmux session will continue to run after you detach from the session.

**Reattach to Tmux Session**

```bash
  tmux ls

  # attach to session 0
  tmux attach-session -t 0
```

#### Common Tmux commands for managing windows and panes

```
- Ctrl+b c  Create a new window (with shell)
- Ctrl+b w  Display an interactive list of windows
- Ctrl+b 0  Switch to window 0 (by number)
- Ctrl+b ,  Rename the current window

- Ctrl+b %  Split current pane horizontally into two panes
- Ctrl+b "  Split current pane vertically into two panes
- Ctrl+b o  Go to the next pane
- Ctrl+b ;  Toggle between the current and previous pane
- Ctrl+b {  Move pane left
- Ctrl+b }  Move pane right
- Ctrl+b x  Close the current pane

- Ctrl+b arrow  Switch between panes
```

#### Resize Panes

The size of each pane can be changed: CTRL+b :

The bottom bar will change from green to yellow:

- resize-pane -D : Moves the boundary line for the pane downward.
- resize-pane -U : Moves the boundary line for the pane upward.
- resize-pane -R : Moves the boundary line for the pane right.
- resize-pane -L : Moves the boundary line for the pane left.

We can specify a specific number of cells to move the boundary line.

resize-pane -U 10 : Moves the boundary line up 10 cells.

We can specify a different cell than the one we are currently working in. 

Resize Cell 2 (lower right):

resize-pane –t 2 --R 5 : Moves the boundary line 5 cells to the right.
